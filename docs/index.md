I am Devansh Tripathi, an applied mathematics student at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research ([IISER](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in)), Thiruvananthapuram, India. I am currently in $3^{rd}$ year of integrated BS-MS degree.  

### Upcoming 

I am very excited to be a project mobility student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), Switzerland in the upcoming summer of 2025. I will be working on design and rigorous analysis of Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) and their applications in computational PDEs with [Prof. Dr. Siddhartha Mishra](https://camlab.ethz.ch/the-group/group-head.html) at [CAMLab](https://camlab.ethz.ch/).
