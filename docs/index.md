### News

[May $\sim$ Aug, 2025] I am currently a project mobility student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), Switzerland. I will be working on mathematical analysis of Neural Operators and foundation models in computational PDEs with [Prof. Dr. Siddhartha Mishra](https://camlab.ethz.ch/the-group/group-head.html) at [CAMLab](https://camlab.ethz.ch/). Specifically, I worked on proving universal approximation property (UAP) for Geometry aware Operator transformer (GAOT) using techniques from classical PDE analysis, functional and Fourier analysis.

## Research
My research interests include:  

- Mathematical Analysis of PDEs.
- Geometric Analysis
- Harmonic Analysis (in relation to PDEs)
