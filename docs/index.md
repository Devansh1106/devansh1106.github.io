    I am Devansh Tripathi, an applied mathematics student at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research 
    <a href="https://www.iisertvm.ac.in">[IISER]</a>, Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, India. I am currently in 4<sup>th</sup> year of integrated BS-MS degree. I am particularly interested in computational partial differential equations (PDEs), mathematical analysis of PDEs and deep learning. Email: devansh22 (at) iisertvm (dot) ac (dot) in

### On-going 

I am currently a project mobility student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), Switzerland. I will be working on mathematical analysis of Neural Operators and their applications in computational PDEs with [Prof. Dr. Siddhartha Mishra](https://camlab.ethz.ch/the-group/group-head.html) at [CAMLab](https://camlab.ethz.ch/).

## Research
My research interests include:  

- Numerical Solution of ODEs/PDEs 
- Mathematical Analysis of Deep Learning, Neural Operators 
- Parallel Computing  
- Machine Learning
