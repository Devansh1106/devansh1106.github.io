Every year TIFR CAM offer summer internships to several undergraduate and graduate students from around the country to work with faculty on various research projects culminating sometimes in new results. The aim of this internship is to expose the student to an academic research experience and for the student to work towards problems of importance.  
  
Under this fellowship, I will be doing a project under the supervision of [Prof. Praveen Chandrashekar](http://cpraveen.github.io/) with my mentor [Dr. Arpit Babbar](https://babbar.dev/). The project is titled as "Distributed memory parallelization of Lax-Wendroff Flux Reconstruction". The project report can be found [here](https://github.com/Devansh1106/internship_tifr_cam2024).
