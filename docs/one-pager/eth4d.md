I have been awarded [ETH4D fellowship](https://eth4d.ethz.ch/) to support my research stay at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. I will be working on mathematical analysis of Neural Operators and their applications in computational PDEs with [Prof. Dr. Siddhartha Mishra](https://camlab.ethz.ch/the-group/group-head.html) at [CAMLab](https://camlab.ethz.ch/). Specifically, I worked on proving universal approximation property (UAP) for Geometry aware Operator transformer (GAOT) using techniques from classical PDE analysis, functional and Fourier analysis.  

The period of my stay is May ~ August, 2025.  

[Edit: Aug, 2025] Universal approximation property for GAOT states that: GAOT can approximate any continuous solution operator between $L^p$ function spaces to any arbitrary accuracy. I was able to show that GAOT is indeed a universal approximator and hence providing a theoretical foundation to the model.
