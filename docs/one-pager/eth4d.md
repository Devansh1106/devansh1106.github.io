I have been awarded [ETH4D fellowship](https://eth4d.ethz.ch/) to support my research stay at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. I will be working on design and rigorous analysis of Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) and their applications in computational PDEs with [Prof. Dr. Siddhartha Mishra](https://camlab.ethz.ch/the-group/group-head.html) at [CAMLab](https://camlab.ethz.ch/).

The period of my stay is May ~ August, 2025.
